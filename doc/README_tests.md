## Objectives

Here we explain the tests we've made. We did different tests, below each tests are explained how are they made.

### **Unit tests**

For the test we have used different tools. 

We've used Mockito to test our Servlet (presentation tier), simple JUnit test for our classes and Arquillian for the integration tier (DAO).

We have not tested all of our classes but only few. Unfortunately not had enough time because of many bugs.

We have good results on the simple class test and the one using Mockito. But the one with Arquillian we got few problems.

### Performance and load tests

To be completed...

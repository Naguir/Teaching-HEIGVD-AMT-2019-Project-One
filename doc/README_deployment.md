Authors : Robel Teklehaimanot & Nair Alic

## Objectives

Here are the steps on **how to deploy** the web application on your machine. We've used docker to package all the components. Please install docker if not already.

- First of all clone the git repo : `git clone https://github.com/Naguir/Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-2019-Project-One.git`
- Then move to the directory you cloned and again to **topology-amt**
- Make sure your docker is running and type `docker-compose up --build`
- Navigate to http://192.168.99.100:8080 if you have docker-machine installed. If it's Docker for Windows/Mac, you'll have to navigate to http://localhost:8080
- The login page should appear. Few accounts are already set up.
- Follow [this link](./README_usability.md) to know how to use the Web application.

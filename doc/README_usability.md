Once you've registered, you will be redirected to the login page, where you can connect.

### Navigation

After you have logged in, the main page will appear. It will depend if you're an administrator or not. For example, the account "nal" is an administrator and "rtt" isn't. Administrator coaches have the possibility to manage teams, coaches and players. Simple coaches can only manage his teams and his profile.
